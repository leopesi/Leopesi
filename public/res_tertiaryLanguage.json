First, it was found that it is necessary to create a UI and UX design to improve the user experience and ensure that the tool achieves its goals. This is because EasyPool has several features and configuration options, which can make its use complex and difficult for some users.; Additionally, it was observed that the calculation of custom pools requires extra and specific inputs for each project, such as the calculation of the perimeter, maximum length, and maximum width, which need to be done manually. To facilitate this process, it would be recommended to introduce suggested models of irregularly shaped pools, which could be adapted to the needs of each user.; Another highlight of the tests was the validation of the formulas created for calculating pool dimensions, equipment sizing, payment methods, material lists, etc. All formulas were checked and approved, ensuring the accuracy of the calculations and the reliability of the information provided by EasyPool."
