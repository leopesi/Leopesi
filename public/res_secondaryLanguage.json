In extreme cases, children can get trapped by the suction at the pool's bottom drain, which can result in serious injuries or even death."

Firstly, it was identified that a UI and UX design project is necessary to enhance the user experience and ensure the tool achieves its objectives. This is because EasyPool has numerous features and configuration options, which can make it complex and challenging for some users to navigate. Additionally, it was observed that calculating custom pools requires extra and specific inputs for each project, such as perimeter calculation, maximum length, and maximum width, which need to be done manually. To streamline this process, it would be recommended to introduce suggested pool models with irregular shapes that can be adapted to each user's needs. Another point highlighted in the tests was the validation of formulas created for calculations of pool dimensions, equipment sizing, payment methods, materials list, etc. All formulas were reviewed and approved, ensuring the accuracy of calculations and the reliability of information provided by EasyPool."
